It is a very easy labeling tool for YOLO image detection .

![Sobanis Labeling ](screenshot.png)

Simply select an image, then use the Crop/Edit button to rotate or crop it.

Start labeling easily by selecting a label from the dropdown list on the right side and left and right clicking on the image. 

finally  press "Add label" or use Ctrl + A.

If you have already labeled some images and trained a model, the Auto Label button can automatically label the image for you, which you can then correct if needed.

This version of the application is written in Python. However, I am currently working on a new version using Delphi, which will be released soon and is more user-freindly.

Feel free to fork it and pls refrence me when doing so. 

Good luck!
